# Explain for solution using sliding window on problem 1358 daily 11/3/2025

- Use array exactly 3 element representation for the number frequently a,b,c
- Traversal from right pointer to end array
- Each indicate update the frequencies of s[r] - 'a' (optmized than directly a to freq)
- With second for loop with purpose:
  - If each element representation for a, b, c greater than 0
  - If satisfacted, update total plus len(s) minus r
    - Why? Because string above was satisfacted if add any elements after r pointer are valid.
  - Remove freq of left pointer (before is right)
  - Plus left pointer
- Return total

Based on the topics we've covered previously (IAM, AWS CLI, IAM Roles, etc.), I'll generate some multiple-choice questions related to **IAM Roles for AWS Services**. Each question will have four answer options, with one correct answer. Here are five questions:

### **Questions on IAM Roles for AWS Services**

#### **Question 1: Purpose of IAM Roles**

What is the primary purpose of using IAM roles for AWS services?  
a) To provide long-term credentials like access keys for services  
b) To allow AWS services to securely interact with other AWS resources  
c) To manage user passwords for console access  
d) To store encryption keys for S3 buckets  
**Correct Answer**: b) To allow AWS services to securely interact with other AWS resources

---

#### **Question 2: Trust Relationship**

What does the "trust relationship" in an IAM role define?  
a) The permissions the role grants to a service  
b) The AWS resources the role can access  
c) The entity (e.g., service or user) that can assume the role  
d) The encryption method used for temporary credentials  
**Correct Answer**: c) The entity (e.g., service or user) that can assume the role

#### **Question 3: Attaching a Role to EC2**

When attaching an IAM role to an existing EC2 instance, what must you do first if the instance is running?  
a) Delete the instance and launch a new one  
b) Stop the instance before attaching the role  
c) Reboot the instance without stopping it  
d) Update the instance’s security group  
**Correct Answer**: b) Stop the instance before attaching the role

#### **Question 4: Temporary Credentials**

How does an AWS service like EC2 obtain permissions when assuming an IAM role?  
a) By using permanent access keys stored in the role  
b) By receiving temporary credentials from the AWS Security Token Service (STS)  
c) By directly accessing the IAM policy database  
d) By prompting the user for an MFA code  
**Correct Answer**: b) By receiving temporary credentials from the AWS Security Token Service (STS)

#### **Question 5: Testing Role Permissions**

After attaching an IAM role with `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess` to an EC2 instance, which command can you run to verify S3 access without configuring credentials?  
a) `aws s3 cp myfile.txt s3://my-bucket/`  
b) `aws s3 ls`  
c) `aws configure`  
d) `aws sts get-caller-identity`  
**Correct Answer**: b) `aws s3 ls`

---

### **Explanation of Answers**

1. **Purpose**: IAM roles eliminate the need for long-term credentials, enabling secure, temporary access for services (not users or encryption keys).
2. **Trust Relationship**: This specifies who can assume the role (e.g., `ec2.amazonaws.com`), not the permissions or resources.
3. **Attaching to EC2**: AWS requires stopping a running instance to modify its IAM role, as it’s part of the instance profile.
4. **Temporary Credentials**: STS provides short-lived credentials when a role is assumed, enhancing security over permanent keys.
5. **Testing**: `aws s3 ls` tests read access to S3 buckets using the role’s temporary credentials, while other options either require configuration or test unrelated functionality.

### **More Questions on IAM Roles for AWS Services**

#### **Question 6: Role Permissions Policy**

What does the permissions policy attached to an IAM role define?  
a) The AWS services that can assume the role  
b) The actions and resources the role can access  
c) The duration of temporary credentials issued by the role  
d) The MFA requirements for assuming the role  
**Correct Answer**: b) The actions and resources the role can access

---

#### **Question 7: Assuming a Role**

Which AWS service is responsible for generating temporary credentials when an IAM role is assumed?  
a) AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
b) AWS Security Token Service (STS)  
c) AWS CloudTrail  
d) Amazon GuardDuty  
**Correct Answer**: b) AWS Security Token Service (STS)

---

#### **Question 8: Role Use Case**

Which of the following is a common use case for an IAM role with an AWS service?  
a) Allowing an EC2 instance to send emails via SES  
b) Enabling a user to log in to the AWS Management Console  
c) Storing permanent access keys for an S3 bucket  
d) Encrypting data in an RDS database  
**Correct Answer**: a) Allowing an EC2 instance to send emails via SES

---

#### **Question 9: Modifying a Role**

If you update an IAM role’s permissions policy (e.g., adding S3 write access), what happens to an EC2 instance already using that role?  
a) The instance must be rebooted to apply the changes  
b) The changes take effect immediately without rebooting  
c) The instance must be terminated and relaunched  
d) The role must be detached and reattached to the instance  
**Correct Answer**: b) The changes take effect immediately without rebooting

---

#### **Question 10: Role vs. Access Keys**

Why is using an IAM role for an AWS service preferred over using access keys?  
a) Roles provide permanent credentials that never expire  
b) Roles reduce the need to manage and rotate long-term credentials  
c) Roles allow direct access to the IAM policy database  
d) Roles are required for all AWS services by default  
**Correct Answer**: b) Roles reduce the need to manage and rotate long-term credentials

### **Explanation of Answers**

6. **Permissions Policy**: This JSON document specifies what the role can do (e.g., `s3:GetObject`), not who can assume it or credential duration.
7. **STS**: The Security Token Service generates temporary credentials for role assumption, not IAM itself or other services.
8. **Use Case**: Roles are commonly used to grant AWS services (like EC2) permissions (e.g., SES access), not for user logins or encryption tasks.
9. **Modifying Role**: AWS applies policy updates dynamically; the EC2 instance’s temporary credentials refresh automatically (typically every hour).
10. **Role vs. Access Keys**: Roles use temporary credentials via STS, avoiding the security risks and management overhead of static access keys.
